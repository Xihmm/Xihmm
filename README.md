### 🚣 Beyond the Screen
When I'm not coding or drafting PRDs, you can find me:
- **On the Water:** Former Varsity Rower & Dragon Boat racer. I believe in "rowing hard, coding harder"—the discipline from 5:20 AM practices translates directly into my work ethic.
- **At the Gym:** Passionate about weightlifting and high-intensity workouts.
- **On Horseback:** I have a deep love for horseback riding and the focus it requires.
